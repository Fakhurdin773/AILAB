No tension, bhai! I'll explain everything from scratch in a super simple way. Let‚Äôs go step by step so you can ace your exam.
Q1: Uninformed Search Algorithms

Uninformed search means the algorithm has no clue about the goal‚Äîjust blindly explores until it finds the solution. These include:
1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

    Explores level by level (like a ripple effect).
    Uses a queue (FIFO).
    Guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Example:
Imagine a maze where you are exploring all paths equally, step by step, moving outward from the start point.

‚úÖ Best for: Finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs.
‚ùå Bad for: Deep trees (because it needs a lot of memory).
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)

    Goes deep in one direction before backtracking.
    Uses a stack (LIFO) (or recursion).
    Doesn't guarantee the shortest path but finds a solution quickly.

Example:
Imagine you're in a cave, and you keep moving deeper into tunnels until you hit a dead end, then backtrack and explore another path.

‚úÖ Best for: Exploring deep structures like trees.
‚ùå Bad for: Graphs with infinite loops (without a visited set, it can go on forever).
3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS)

    Like BFS but considers cost (shortest path in weighted graphs).
    Uses a priority queue (expands the least-cost node first).
    Guarantees the lowest cost path.

Example:
Finding the cheapest flight from Karachi to Lahore‚ÄîUCS picks the cheapest ticket first rather than shortest distance.

‚úÖ Best for: Weighted graphs.
‚ùå Bad for: Large graphs (since it expands all possible paths).
Q2: Informed Search Algorithms

Informed means the algorithm uses heuristics (estimates) to search faster.
1. Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)

    Uses a heuristic function h(n) (which guesses the distance to the goal).
    Moves toward what looks closest to the goal.
    Doesn't guarantee the shortest path.

Example:
Imagine you're hungry and see a restaurant visually nearby. You go towards it, but there‚Äôs a wall in between, so you backtrack.

‚úÖ Best for: Fast searches when heuristics are good.
‚ùå Bad for: Getting trapped in dead ends.
2. A Search (A-Star)*

    Uses both cost so far (g(n)) + heuristic estimate (h(n)).
    Finds the optimal shortest path if heuristics are good.
    Uses a priority queue like UCS but smarter.

Formula:
f(n)=g(n)+h(n)
f(n)=g(n)+h(n)

Where:

    g(n)g(n) = actual cost so far.
    h(n)h(n) = estimated cost to the goal.

Example:
Google Maps uses A* to find the shortest route, considering both distance traveled (g) and estimated distance remaining (h).

‚úÖ Best for: Shortest path problems.
‚ùå Bad for: If heuristics are bad, it behaves like UCS.
Q3: Genetic Algorithms (GA)

GA is inspired by evolution (survival of the fittest). It works in iterations (generations) and improves over time.
Steps in GA:

    Initialization ‚Üí Create a random population.
    Selection ‚Üí Pick the best individuals for reproduction.
    Crossover ‚Üí Mix two parents to make a child.
    Mutation ‚Üí Make small changes to add randomness.
    Fitness Function ‚Üí Evaluate how "good" a solution is.
    Repeat until the best solution is found.

1. Crossover Techniques (Mating of two solutions)

Crossover is like mixing genes from parents.

    Single-Point Crossover ‚Üí Cut at one point, swap the rest.
    Two-Point Crossover ‚Üí Cut at two points, swap the middle.
    Uniform Crossover ‚Üí Randomly pick genes from both parents.
    Cyclic Crossover (CX) ‚Üí Preserve cycles in permutations.
    Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX) ‚Üí Swap segments, keeping order.
    Ordered Crossover (OX) ‚Üí Keep order in permutations.

2. Selection Criteria (Who gets to reproduce?)

    Roulette Wheel Selection ‚Üí Probability-based (better fitness = more chances).
    Tournament Selection ‚Üí Pick best from a random group.
    Rank-Based Selection ‚Üí Higher ranked individuals are chosen.
    Elitism ‚Üí Always carry forward the best individuals.

3. Fitness Function (Evaluates how good a solution is)

Modify fitness function based on the problem:

    Chess ‚Üí Number of captured pieces.
    8-Puzzle ‚Üí Number of misplaced tiles.
    Maze Solving ‚Üí Steps to the goal.
    N-Queens ‚Üí Number of non-attacking queens.

How to Prepare?

    Understand BFS, DFS, UCS concepts.
    Know when to use GBFS vs A.*
    Be able to modify selection/crossover in GA code.

Q1: Uninformed Search Algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS)
1. Breadth-First Search (BFS) - Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph

    Uses Queue (FIFO)
    Explores level by level
    Guaranteed shortest path in an unweighted graph

Code for BFS

from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start, goal):
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])  # Store (current_node, path_so_far)
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        node, path = queue.popleft()  # FIFO: Remove from front
        if node == goal:
            return path  # Return shortest path

        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))  # Add new path

    return None  # No path found

# Example graph (Adjacency List)
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}

print(bfs(graph, 'A', 'F'))  # Output: ['A', 'C', 'F']

Explanation:

    Start from A, add its neighbors (B, C) to the queue.
    Process B, add D, E to the queue.
    Process C, add F to the queue.
    As soon as F is reached, return the path.

‚úÖ Best for: Finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs.
‚ùå Bad for: Large graphs (high memory usage).
2. Depth-First Search (DFS) - Exploring Deep Paths

    Uses Stack (LIFO)
    Explores deeper first
    May not find shortest path

Code for DFS (Recursive)

def dfs(graph, node, goal, path=None, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    if path is None:
        path = []

    path.append(node)
    visited.add(node)

    if node == goal:
        return path  # Found the goal

    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            result = dfs(graph, neighbor, goal, path.copy(), visited)
            if result:
                return result  # Return first found path

    return None  # No path found

print(dfs(graph, 'A', 'F'))  # Output: ['A', 'C', 'F'] OR another valid path

‚úÖ Best for: Exploring deep structures (like game trees).
‚ùå Bad for: Finding the shortest path.
3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS) - Shortest Path in Weighted Graph

    Uses Priority Queue (Lowest Cost First)
    Finds the optimal path in a weighted graph

Code for UCS

import heapq

def ucs(graph, start, goal):
    queue = [(0, start, [start])]  # (cost, node, path)
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        cost, node, path = heapq.heappop(queue)  # Get the lowest cost node
        if node == goal:
            return path, cost  # Return path and cost

        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
                heapq.heappush(queue, (cost + weight, neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

    return None

# Weighted graph
graph = {
    'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],
    'B': [('D', 2), ('E', 5)],
    'C': [('F', 1)],
    'D': [],
    'E': [('F', 2)],
    'F': []
}

print(ucs(graph, 'A', 'F'))  # Output: (['A', 'C', 'F'], 5)

‚úÖ Best for: Finding the cheapest path in weighted graphs.
Q2: Informed Search (Greedy & A)*
1. Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)

    Uses only heuristic function h(n)h(n)
    Faster but may get stuck in wrong paths

import heapq

def heuristic(node, goal):
    h_values = {'A': 5, 'B': 2, 'C': 3, 'D': 1, 'E': 2, 'F': 0}
    return h_values[node]

def greedy_bfs(graph, start, goal):
    queue = [(heuristic(start, goal), start, [start])]
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        _, node, path = heapq.heappop(queue)  # Prioritize lowest h(n)
        if node == goal:
            return path  # Goal reached

        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                heapq.heappush(queue, (heuristic(neighbor, goal), neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

    return None

print(greedy_bfs(graph, 'A', 'F'))  # Might not find the best path

‚úÖ Fast but non-optimal.
2. A Search (A-Star)*

    Uses both cost g(n)g(n) and heuristic h(n)h(n)
    Always finds optimal path

def a_star(graph, start, goal):
    queue = [(0 + heuristic(start, goal), 0, start, [start])]  # (f(n), g(n), node, path)
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        _, cost, node, path = heapq.heappop(queue)
        if node == goal:
            return path, cost  # Optimal path

        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
                g_new = cost + weight
                f_new = g_new + heuristic(neighbor, goal)
                heapq.heappush(queue, (f_new, g_new, neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

    return None

print(a_star(graph, 'A', 'F'))  # Always finds the best path

Q1: Depth-First Search (DFS) for Finding a Path in a Grid
Problem Breakdown

    Grid Representation:
        A ‚Üí Agent‚Äôs starting position
        P ‚Üí Person trapped
        0 ‚Üí Safe rooms (can move here)
        # ‚Üí Walls (cannot pass)
        F ‚Üí Fire (avoid this)
    Goal: Find the shortest path from A to P using DFS.
    Allowed Moves: Only through 0 (safe rooms).

Approach

    Use DFS (Depth-First Search):
        Recursively explore paths.
        Backtrack if a path leads to a dead end.
    Keep track of visited nodes to avoid loops.
    Record the path from A to P.

DFS Solution

def dfs(grid, x, y, path, visited):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])

    # If out of bounds or at a wall/fire, return False
    if x < 0 or x >= rows or y < 0 or y >= cols or grid[x][y] in ('#', 'F') or (x, y) in visited:
        return False

    # If reached 'P', return True
    if grid[x][y] == 'P':
        path.append((x, y))
        return True

    # Mark current cell as visited
    visited.add((x, y))
    path.append((x, y))

    # Move in 4 directions: Right, Down, Left, Up
    if dfs(grid, x, y + 1, path, visited) or dfs(grid, x + 1, y, path, visited) or \
       dfs(grid, x, y - 1, path, visited) or dfs(grid, x - 1, y, path, visited):

    return False

def find_path_dfs(grid):

Q2: A Search Algorithm for Shortest Path*
Problem Breakdown

    Grid Representation:
        # ‚Üí Blocked cell (cannot pass)
        0-9 ‚Üí Cost of movement (higher values = more expensive path)
    Goal: Find the least-cost path from the start to a goal using A Search*.

Approach

    A Search Algorithm*:
        Uses priority queue (min-heap).
        Evaluates both cost-so-far g(n)g(n) and heuristic h(n)h(n).
        Heuristic: Use Manhattan Distance (absolute difference in x and y).

                new_cost = costs[current] + int(grid[nx][ny])  # Cost calculation
                if (nx, ny) not in costs or new_cost < costs[(nx, ny)]:

                    came_from[(nx, ny)] = current

    return None  # No path found

# Example Grid (Numbers = Movement Costs)

goal = (4, 4)  # Goal position (e.g., 'G')

path, cost = a_star(grid, start, goal)
print("Shortest Path:", path)
print("Total Cost:", cost)

    Uses A search* for an optimal path.
    Uses Manhattan distance heuristic.
    Finds the least-cost path while avoiding obstacles.

Let me know if you need any modifications! üòÉ

How to Know Which Algorithm to Apply?

When solving search problems, choosing the right algorithm depends on:

    Graph Structure (Tree, Grid, Weighted Graph, etc.)
    Goal (Find any path, shortest path, least-cost path, etc.)
    Constraints (Time, Memory, Complexity)

1Ô∏è‚É£ When to Use Depth-First Search (DFS)?

‚úÖ Use DFS when:

    You just need a path (not necessarily the shortest one).
    Memory is limited (DFS uses less memory than BFS in some cases).
    You need to explore all possible paths deeply before backtracking (like a maze).
    There are no weighted costs (DFS treats all paths equally).

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid DFS if:

    The shortest path is required (DFS might not find it).
    The search space is too deep (can get stuck in infinite recursion).

üí° Example Problems for DFS:

    Maze solving (finding any exit path).
    Connected components in a graph.
    Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder).

üîç Example: DFS in a Grid

def dfs(grid, x, y, visited):
    if grid[x][y] == 'P':  # Found the goal
        return True
    visited.add((x, y))
    
    for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:  # Right, Down, Left, Up
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] != '#':
            if dfs(grid, nx, ny, visited):
                return True
    return False

2Ô∏è‚É£ When to Use Breadth-First Search (BFS)?

‚úÖ Use BFS when:

    You need the shortest path in an unweighted graph/grid.
    You want to explore all possible paths level by level.
    There are no weighted movement costs.

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid BFS if:

    The grid is too large (BFS requires more memory).
    You need to prioritize certain paths (use A* instead).

üí° Example Problems for BFS:

    Finding the shortest path in a maze/grid without weights.
    Solving word ladder problems (e.g., "hit" ‚Üí "hot" ‚Üí "dot" ‚Üí "dog" ‚Üí "cog").
    Social network analysis (finding the shortest connection between people).

üîç Example: BFS in a Grid

from collections import deque

def bfs(grid, start, goal):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = {start: None}
    
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == goal:
            break  # Reached the goal
        
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] != '#':
                queue.append((nx, ny))
                visited[(nx, ny)] = (x, y)  # Store the parent node

    # Reconstruct the shortest path
    path = []
    while goal:
        path.append(goal)
        goal = visited.get(goal, None)
    return path[::-1] if path else None

3Ô∏è‚É£ When to Use Uniform Cost Search (UCS)?

‚úÖ Use UCS when:

    You need the shortest path in a weighted graph/grid.
    There are different movement costs (like in maps where roads have different distances).
    You don't have a good heuristic (otherwise, A is better).*

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid UCS if:

    You want to reach the goal faster using a heuristic (A* is better).
    The graph has negative weights (use Bellman-Ford).

üí° Example Problems for UCS:

    Google Maps shortest route (road distances have different costs).
    Robot path planning (some terrains are harder to traverse).
    Finding the cheapest flight path between cities.

üîç Example: UCS in a Grid

import heapq

def ucs(grid, start, goal):
    queue = [(0, start)]  # (cost, position)
    costs = {start: 0}
    
    while queue:
        cost, current = heapq.heappop(queue)
        if current == goal:
            return cost  # Found the shortest cost

        x, y = current
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] != '#':
                new_cost = cost + int(grid[nx][ny])

‚úÖ Use A when:*

    You need the shortest path efficiently.
    The graph has weighted costs.
    You have a good heuristic function to guide the search.

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid A if:*

    You don't have a good heuristic function.
    The graph has negative weights (use Bellman-Ford instead).

üí° Example Problems for A*:

    Game AI pathfinding (moving characters in a game).
    Robot motion planning (finding the best route).

ChatGPT said:
How to Know Which Algorithm Will Work in the Given Questions?

To determine which algorithm is appropriate, we analyze the problem constraints, goals, and given information. Let's break it down for each question.
Question 1: Use DFS
üîç Problem Analysis:

    You need to rescue a trapped person (P) in a burning building.
    The building is represented as a grid.
    The agent (A) can move only through safe rooms (0).
    Fire (F) and walls (#) cannot be traversed.
    Goal: Find a path to reach P from A using DFS.

‚ùå Why Not BFS, UCS, or A?*
Algorithm	Why It Won't Work?
BFS	BFS finds the shortest path, but the problem doesn't ask for it. DFS is easier to implement for this case.
UCS	There are no weights/costs associated with movement.
A*	No need for heuristics. The problem is simple and doesn't require estimating the best path.

‚úÖ DFS is the best choice because:

    The problem only asks for a path, not necessarily the shortest.
    DFS explores deep first, which works well in grid traversal problems when a path must be found.
    The grid is relatively small, so memory usage is not a concern.

üí° DFS Implementation for Q1

def dfs(grid, x, y, visited):
    if grid[x][y] == 'P':  # Found the person
        return [(x, y)]
    
    visited.add((x, y))

    for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:  # Right, Down, Left, Up
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] == '0':
            path = dfs(grid, nx, ny, visited)
            if path:
                return [(x, y)] + path  # Backtrack and construct path

    return None  # No path found

# Example Grid
grid = [
    ['A', '0', '0', '#'],
    ['#', 'F', '0', 'P'],
    ['0', '0', '0', 'F'],
    ['0', '#', 'F', '0']
]

start_x, start_y = 0, 0  # Assume A is at (0,0)
path = dfs(grid, start_x, start_y, set())
print("Path:", path)

Question 2: Use A*
üîç Problem Analysis:

    You need to find the shortest path in an N √ó M grid.
    Each cell has a numerical value representing movement cost.
    Some cells are blocked (#), meaning they cannot be traversed.
    Goal: Find the least-cost path.

‚ùå Why Not DFS or BFS?
Algorithm	Why It Won't Work?
DFS	DFS does not guarantee the shortest path; it explores deep first.
BFS	BFS finds the shortest path only in an unweighted grid (all movements cost the same). This problem has variable costs, so BFS won't work.
UCS	UCS will work but is slower than A* because it doesn't use a heuristic.

‚úÖ A* is the best choice because:

    The problem has weighted movement costs, which rules out DFS and BFS.
    A* finds the shortest path efficiently using a heuristic (e.g., Manhattan distance).
    UCS would work, but A* is faster as it prioritizes promising paths.

üí° How to Decide Which Algorithm to Use?

    Does the problem require finding a path (any path) or the shortest path?
        Any Path ‚Üí Use DFS.
        Shortest Path ‚Üí Consider BFS, UCS, or A*.

    Does the grid/graph have movement costs?
        No costs (uniform weights) ‚Üí Use BFS for the shortest path.
        With costs (different movement values per cell) ‚Üí Use A* (or UCS if no heuristic is available).

    Does the problem allow backtracking?
        DFS is good for exploration problems (mazes, games).
        A* is good for optimized pathfinding (maps, weighted grids).

üí° DFS Implementation for Q1
look i have studied c++ and C not python syntax confuse little bit
ChatGPT said:

Got it! I'll explain the DFS and A* implementations in C++ instead of Python.
üî¥ Question 1: DFS Implementation in C++

Problem: Navigate the grid using DFS to find a path from A (agent) to P (person).
Approach:

    Use DFS with recursion.
    Use a visited array to avoid revisiting cells.
    Traverse only valid cells (0) (not # or F).

üîπ C++ Code for DFS Grid Traversal

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Directions: Right, Down, Left, Up
int dx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int dy[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};

// Grid size
const int N = 4, M = 4;
bool visited[N][M];  // Visited array to track path

// Function to perform DFS
bool dfs(vector<vector<char>> &grid, int x, int y, vector<pair<int, int>> &path) {
    if (grid[x][y] == 'P') { // Found the person
        path.push_back({x, y});
        return true;
    }
    
    visited[x][y] = true;
    path.push_back({x, y});
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {  // Try all directions
        int nx = x + dx[i], ny = y + dy[i];

        // Check boundary and valid move
        if (nx >= 0 && nx < N && ny >= 0 && ny < M && !visited[nx][ny] && grid[nx][ny] != '#' && grid[nx][ny] != 'F') {
            if (dfs(grid, nx, ny, path)) return true;
        }
    }

    path.pop_back();  // Backtrack if no path found
    return false;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<char>> grid = {
        {'A', '0', '0', '#'},
        {'#', 'F', '0', 'P'},
        {'0', '0', '0', 'F'},
        {'0', '#', 'F', '0'}
    };

    vector<pair<int, int>> path;
    int startX = 0, startY = 0;  // Assume 'A' is at (0,0)

    if (dfs(grid, startX, startY, path)) {
        cout << "Path Found:\n";
        for (auto p : path) cout << "(" << p.first << ", " << p.second << ") -> ";
        cout << "P\n";
    } else {
        cout << "No path found!\n";
    }

    return 0;
}

üìå How it Works?

    dfs() explores the grid recursively.
    Base case: If we reach P, stop and return the path.
    Recursive exploration: Try moving Right ‚Üí Down ‚Üí Left ‚Üí Up.
    Backtracking: If we reach a dead end, remove the last move and try another.

‚úÖ Best choice because: DFS finds a path (not necessarily the shortest) efficiently.
üîµ Question 2: A Algorithm in C++*

Problem: Find the shortest path in a weighted grid where each cell has a movement cost.
Approach:

    Use A* with a priority queue.
    Use Manhattan Distance as a heuristic (h(x) = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|).
    Maintain cost array to track the best known cost for each cell.

üîπ C++ Code for A*

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

typedef pair<int, int> pii;  // (x, y) coordinates

// Directions: Right, Down, Left, Up
int dx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int dy[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};

// Grid size
const int N = 4, M = 4;

// A* Algorithm
vector<pii> a_star(vector<vector<int>> &grid, pii start, pii goal) {
    priority_queue<pair<int, pii>, vector<pair<int, pii>>, greater<pair<int, pii>>> pq;
    vector<vector<int>> cost(N, vector<int>(M, 1e9));
    vector<vector<pii>> parent(N, vector<pii>(M, {-1, -1}));

    cost[start.first][start.second] = 0;
    pq.push({0, start});

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [currCost, curr] = pq.top();
        pq

üî¥ Question 1: DFS (Depth-First Search)
Understanding DFS in a Grid

    DFS explores a path as far as possible before backtracking.
    It uses a stack (LIFO) to track paths.
    The agent can only move in valid directions (up, down, left, right).
    We need to avoid obstacles (#), fire (F), and out-of-bound moves.
    The goal is to find a path from A (agent) to P (person).

üîπ DFS Algorithm Steps

    Find the starting position (A) in the grid.
    Use a stack (or recursion) to explore paths.
    Mark visited positions so we don‚Äôt revisit them.
    Backtrack if no valid path exists.
    Stop when we reach P (person).

üîπ Python Code for DFS

# Define the grid (example)
grid = [
    ['A', '0', '0', '#', '#'],
    ['#', 'F', '0', 'P', '#'],
    ['0', '0', '0', 'F', '0'],
    ['0', 'F', 'F', '#', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']
]

# Directions (right, down, left, up)
directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

def find_start(grid):
    """Find the starting position (A) in the grid"""
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] == 'A':
                return i, j  # Return row, column
    return None  # Should never happen if 'A' is always present

def dfs(grid, x, y, visited, path):
    """Depth-First Search to find the path from 'A' to 'P'"""
    if grid[x][y] == 'P':  
        return True  # Found the person!

    visited.add((x, y))  # Mark this cell as visited

    # Try all 4 possible moves
    for dx, dy in directions:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy  # Calculate new position

        # Check if move is valid
        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]):  # Stay inside grid
            if (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] in ('0', 'P'):  
                path.append((nx, ny))  # Add move to path
                if dfs(grid, nx, ny, visited, path):  
                    return True  # If found 'P', stop
                path.pop()  # Backtrack if dead-end

    return False  # No valid path found

# Find start position
start_x, start_y = find_start(grid)

# Run DFS
visited = set()  # To track visited cells
path = [(start_x, start_y)]  # Store the path
if dfs(grid, start_x, start_y, visited, path):
    print("Path found:", path)
else:
    print("No path found")

üîπ How It Works

    Find 'A' in the grid using find_start(grid).
    Run DFS from 'A':
        If we reach P, we return True.
        If the next cell is valid (0 or P), move there.
        If stuck, backtrack and try a different path.
    Track the path in path[] to see the movement.
    Stop when P is found or all paths fail.

üîµ Question 2: A Algorithm*
Understanding A*

    A* is an informed search (uses a heuristic).
    It chooses paths that seem optimal based on:
        g(n) ‚Üí Cost from start to current node.
        h(n) ‚Üí Estimated cost from current node to goal (heuristic).
        f(n) = g(n) + h(n) ‚Üí Total cost.
    Heuristic (h): We can use Manhattan Distance for a 2D grid:
    h(n)=‚à£xcurrent‚àíxgoal‚à£+‚à£ycurrent‚àíygoal‚à£
    h(n)=‚à£xcurrent‚Äã‚àíxgoal‚Äã‚à£+‚à£ycurrent‚Äã‚àíygoal‚Äã‚à£

üîπ A Algorithm Steps*

    Use a priority queue (min-heap) to explore the best path first.

Let's break down each part of this DFS pathfinding logic in Python, assuming the grid-based problem you are working on.
üîπ Code Explanation

visited.add((x, y))

    This marks the current cell (x, y) as visited.
    visited is a set that stores cells we have already explored.
    Why? To avoid revisiting cells and getting stuck in infinite loops.

for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:  

    This loops over all possible moves in a 2D grid.
    The directions represent:
        (0, 1) ‚Üí Right
        (1, 0) ‚Üí Down
        (0, -1) ‚Üí Left
        (-1, 0) ‚Üí Up
    Why? To explore adjacent cells.

nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

    This calculates the new position (nx, ny) by adding the movement offsets.
    Example:
        If we are at (2,2) and move right (0,1), the new position is (2,3).
        If we move down (1,0), the new position is (3,2).

if (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] == '0':

    This checks if the new cell (nx, ny) is a valid move:
        (nx, ny) not in visited ‚Üí To avoid revisiting cells.
        grid[nx][ny] == '0' ‚Üí To ensure it's walkable (i.e., not a wall # or fire F).

path = dfs(grid, nx, ny, visited)

    Recursive DFS call to continue searching from (nx, ny).
    If dfs() finds a valid path to the goal, it will return that path.

if path:
    return [(x, y)] + path  # Backtrack and construct path

    If a path to P is found, we add (x, y) to the path and return it.
    Example:
        Suppose path = [(3,3), (3,4), (4,4)]
        If we are at (3,2), the final path becomes [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)].

return None  # No path found

    If no valid move leads to P, return None (meaning this path is a dead end).

what d doing here where it come from dx dy where d is comming from 
ChatGPT said:

The dx, dy values are coming from this loop:

for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:

üöÄ What is happening here?

    This is a loop over direction vectors.
    dx and dy are not predefined; they are being assigned values from the list [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)].

üåç Understanding dx, dy

Each (dx, dy) represents a possible move in a 2D grid:
Move	dx, dy	Meaning
Right	(0, 1)	Move right (same row, next column)
Down	(1, 0)	Move down (next row, same column)
Left	(0, -1)	Move left (same row, previous column)
Up	(-1, 0)	Move up (previous row, same column)
üîç Example Execution

Let's assume x = 2, y = 2 (some position on the grid).
We now iterate through dx, dy:

1Ô∏è‚É£ First Iteration:

dx, dy = (0, 1)  # Move Right
nx, ny = 2 + 0, 2 + 1  # (2,3)

‚Üí New position: (2,3), moves right.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Second Iteration:

dx, dy = (1, 0)  # Move Down
nx, ny = 2 + 1, 2 + 0  # (3,2)

‚Üí New position: (3,2), moves down.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Third Iteration:

dx, dy = (0, -1)  # Move Left
nx, ny = 2 + 0, 2 - 1  # (2,1)

‚Üí New position: (2,1), moves left.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Fourth Iteration:

dx, dy = (-1, 0)  # Move Up
nx, ny = 2 - 1, 2 + 0  # (1,2)

‚Üí New position: (1,2), moves up.
üîµ Why use dx, dy?

‚úÖ It makes the code cleaner and shorter instead of writing 4 separate if conditions.
‚úÖ Works for any 2D grid problem involving movement (DFS, BFS, A*).
‚úÖ Prevents hardcoding movement rules.
‚ö° C++ Comparison

In C++, you‚Äôd write it like this:

vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{0,1}, {1,0}, {0,-1}, {-1,0}};

for (auto [dx, dy] : directions) {
    int nx = x + dx;
    int ny = y + dy;
}

Same logic, but Python allows unpacking dx, dy directly.

üü¢ Q1 - Solving with Depth-First Search (DFS)

Problem: A firefighter agent must use DFS to find the shortest path to rescue a trapped person (P) in a burning building grid.

üîç Understanding DFS for this Problem

    DFS explores as deep as possible before backtracking.
    Works well when paths are not weighted.
    We must avoid fire (F) and walls (#).
    The agent (A) can move only on 0 (safe rooms).

üìú Python Implementation

def dfs(grid, start, target):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    stack = [(start, [start])]  # Stack stores (current_position, path_taken)
    visited = set()

    while stack:
        (x, y), path = stack.pop()
        
        if (x, y) in visited:
            continue
        visited.add((x, y))

        if (x, y) == target:  # Found target!
            return path
        
        # Possible directions (right, down, left, up)
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] in {'0', 'P'}:
                stack.append(((nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))

    return None  # No path found

# Example Grid
grid = [
    ['A', '0', '0', '#', '#'],
    ['#', 'F', '0', 'P', '#'],
    ['0', '0', '0', 'F', '0'],
    ['0', 'F', '#', 'F', '#']
]

start = (0, 0)  # Position of 'A'
target = (1, 3)  # Position of 'P'

path = dfs(grid, start, target)
print("Shortest path:", path)

üìå Explanation

    We use a stack for DFS.
    We store visited nodes to avoid loops.
    We explore the grid using dx, dy.
    If the target is found, return the path.

üü¢ Q2 - Solving with A Algorithm*

Problem: Find the shortest path in an N x M grid where each cell has a movement cost. Use Manhattan Distance as a heuristic.

üîç Understanding A*

    Best for shortest path problems where costs vary.
    Uses heuristic (Manhattan Distance) to estimate cost.
    More efficient than DFS in weighted grids.

üìú Python Implementation

import heapq

def heuristic(a, b):
    return abs(a[0] - b[0]) + abs(a[1] - b[1])  # Manhattan Distance

def astar(grid, start, target):

    pq = [(0, start)]  # Priority queue (cost, position)
    g_cost = {start: 0}  # Cost from start to current node
    came_from = {start: None}  # Track path

    while pq:
        cost, (x, y) = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if (x, y) == target:
            path = []
            while (x, y) is not None:
                path.append((x, y))
                x, y = came_from[(x, y)]
            return path[::-1], g_cost[target]  # Return path & cost

        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] != '#':
                new_cost = g_cost[(x, y)] + int(grid[nx][ny])
                if (nx, ny) not in g_cost or new_cost < g_cost[(nx, ny)]:
                    g_cost[(nx, ny)] = new_cost
                    priority = new_cost + heuristic((nx, ny), target)
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (priority, (nx, ny)))
                    came_from[(nx, ny)] = (x, y)

    return None, float('inf')  # No path found

# Example Grid
grid = [
    ['S', '1', '2', '#', '3'],
    ['1', '#', '2', '#', '#'],
    ['2', '1', '2', '1', '2'],
    ['#', '1', '1', '#', 'T']

start = (0, 0)  # 'S'
target = (3, 4)  # 'T'

path, cost = astar(grid, start, target)
print("Optimal path:", path)
print("Total cost:", cost)

üìå Explanation

    Uses priority queue (min-heap) to get the best path.
    g_cost tracks cost from the start.
    heuristic() calculates Manhattan Distance.
    Expands nodes based on cost + heuristic.

Let's break it down step by step with explanations and Python implementations.
1. Crossover Techniques in Genetic Algorithms

Crossover is the process of combining genes from two parent chromosomes to create offspring. Different methods are used depending on the problem.
a) Single-Point Crossover

    A single crossover point is chosen.
    The genes before this point are copied from Parent 1, and the rest from Parent 2.

Python Implementation

import random

def single_point_crossover(parent1, parent2):
    point = random.randint(1, len(parent1) - 1)  # Select a crossover point
    child1 = parent1[:point] + parent2[point:]
    child2 = parent2[:point] + parent1[point:]
    return child1, child2

# Example
p1 = "11010"
p2 = "00111"
c1, c2 = single_point_crossover(p1, p2)
print(c1, c2)

b) Two-Point Crossover

    Two crossover points are chosen.
    The segment between them is swapped.

Python Implementation

def two_point_crossover(parent1, parent2):
    point1, point2 = sorted(random.sample(range(1, len(parent1)), 2))
    child1 = parent1[:point1] + parent2[point1:point2] + parent1[point2:]
    child2 = parent2[:point1] + parent1[point1:point2] + parent2[point2:]
    return child1, child2

p1 = "11010"
p2 = "00111"
c1, c2 = two_point_crossover(p1, p2)
print(c1, c2)

c) Uniform Crossover

    Each gene is randomly chosen from either parent.

Python Implementation

def uniform_crossover(parent1, parent2):
    child1, child2 = "", ""
    for i in range(len(parent1)):
        if random.random() < 0.5:
            child1 += parent1[i]
            child2 += parent2[i]
        else:
            child1 += parent2[i]
            child2 += parent1[i]
    return child1, child2

p1 = "11010"
p2 = "00111"
c1, c2 = uniform_crossover(p1, p2)
print(c1, c2)

d) Cyclic Crossover

    Cyclically inherits genes from alternating parents.

Python Implementation

def cyclic_crossover(parent1, parent2):
    size = len(parent1)
    child1, child2 = ['_'] * size, ['_'] * size
    indices = [0]
    while parent1[indices[-1]] not in indices[:-1]:
        indices.append(parent1.index(parent2[indices[-1]]))
    for i in indices:
        child1[i], child2[i] = parent1[i], parent2[i]
    for i in range(size):
        if child1[i] == '_': child1[i] = parent2[i]
        if child2[i] == '_': child2[i] = parent1[i]
    return "".join(child1), "".join(child2)

p1 = "11010"
p2 = "00111"
c1, c2 = cyclic_crossover(p1, p2)
print(c1, c2)

e) Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX)

    Used for order-based problems like traveling salesman.

Python Implementation

def pmx(parent1, parent2):
    size = len(parent1)
    point1, point2 = sorted(random.sample(range(size), 2))
    child1, child2 = list(parent1), list(parent2)
    mapping1, mapping2 = {}, {}

    for i in range(point1, point2):
        mapping1[parent1[i]] = parent2[i]
        mapping2[parent2[i]] = parent1[i]
        child1[i], child2[i] = parent2[i], parent1[i]

    for i in range(size):
        if i < point1 or i >= point2:
            while child1[i] in mapping1:
                child1[i] = mapping1[child1[i]]
            while child2[i] in mapping2:
                child2[i] = mapping2[child2[i]]

    return "".join(child1), "".join(child2)

p1 = "12345"
p2 = "54321"
c1, c2 = pmx(p1, p2)
print(c1, c2)

2. Selection Methods

Selection is how parents are chosen for crossover.
a) Roulette Wheel Selection

    Probability of selection depends on fitness.

Python Implementation

def roulette_wheel_selection(population, fitnesses):
    total_fitness = sum(fitnesses)
    selection_probs = [f/total_fitness for f in fitnesses]
    return population[random.choices(range(len(population)), weights=selection_probs)[0]]

pop = ["110", "101", "001"]
fit = [2, 5, 3]
selected = roulette_wheel_selection(pop, fit)
print(selected)

b) Tournament Selection

    Randomly selects individuals and picks the fittest.

Python Implementation

def tournament_selection(population, fitnesses, k=3):
    selected = random.sample(range(len(population)), k)
    return population[max(selected, key=lambda i: fitnesses[i])]

pop = ["110", "101", "001"]
fit = [2, 5, 3]
selected = tournament_selection(pop, fit)
print(selected)

c) Rank-Based Selection

    Individuals are ranked based on fitness.

Python Implementation

def rank_based_selection(population, fitnesses):
    ranked = sorted(range(len(population)), key=lambda i: fitnesses[i])
    return population[random.choices(ranked, weights=range(1, len(population)+1))[0]]

pop = ["110", "101", "001"]
fit = [2, 5, 3]
selected = rank_based_selection(pop, fit)
print(selected)

d) Elitism

    Best individuals are directly passed to the next generation.

Python Implementation

def elitism_selection(population, fitnesses, num_elites=1):
    elite_indices = sorted(range(len(population)), key=lambda i: fitnesses[i], reverse=True)[:num_elites]
    return [population[i] for i in elite_indices]

pop = ["110", "101", "001"]
fit = [2, 5, 3]
elites = elitism_selection(pop, fit, num_elites=2)
print(elites)

3. Fitness Functions

The fitness function evaluates how good a solution is.
a) N-Queens Fitness Function

    Counts non-attacking queens.

Python Implementation

def fitness_n_queens(board):
    n = len(board)
    attacks = sum([board.count(q) - 1 for q in board])
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if abs(i - j) == abs(board[i] - board[j]):
                attacks += 1
    return -attacks

board = [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]
print(fitness_n_queens(board))

b) Maze Solving Fitness

    Measures distance to the goal.

Python Implementation

def fitness_maze(position, goal):
    return -abs(position[0] - goal[0]) - abs(position[1] - goal[1])

print(fitness_maze((2,3), (5,6)))

Q3 Breakdown and Implementation Plan

You are required to modify the following in a given GA-based source code:

    ‚Üí Adapt fitness functions for:
        Chess
        8-Puzzle
        Maze Solving
        N-Queens

Step-by-Step Explanation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Genetic Algorithm Flow

A Genetic Algorithm follows these steps:

    Initialize Population ‚Üí Randomly generate solutions.
    Evaluate Fitness ‚Üí Assign scores based on the problem's objective.
    Selection ‚Üí Pick individuals for crossover.
    Crossover ‚Üí Combine parent solutions to create offspring.
    Mutation (Not Required in Q3) ‚Üí Introduce small random changes.
    Replacement ‚Üí New population replaces old one.
    Repeat Until Solution Found

Now, let's implement each step with modifications!
2Ô∏è‚É£ Crossover Techniques

Each crossover method determines how two parents combine to create offspring.
Example: Solving N-Queens with Crossover

    Single-Point Crossover: Swap part of the board configurations.
    Two-Point Crossover: Swap two parts of the board.
    PMX Crossover: Ensures valid queen positions.

import random

# Example: Representing N-Queens as a list [col positions per row]
def single_point_crossover(parent1, parent2):
    point = random.randint(1, len(parent1) - 1)
    child1 = parent1[:point] + parent2[point:]
    child2 = parent2[:point] + parent1[point:]
    return child1, child2

p1 = [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]  # N-Queens board
p2 = [1, 3, 0, 4, 2]
c1, c2 = single_point_crossover(p1, p2)
print("Offspring:", c1, c2)

How it Maps to Q3?

    N-Queens & Chess: Use PMX crossover (validity matters).
    8-Puzzle & Maze Solving: Use Uniform Crossover (flexibility).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Selection Methods

Selection decides which parents participate in crossover.
Example: Solving Maze with Selection

    Roulette Wheel: High fitness = high probability of selection.
    Tournament: Competes between k-random individuals.
    Elitism: Keeps the best solutions.

def roulette_wheel_selection(population, fitnesses):
    total_fitness = sum(fitnesses)
    selection_probs = [f/total_fitness for f in fitnesses]
    return population[random.choices(range(len(population)), weights=selection_probs)[0]]

# Example: Maze Solving
pop = [(2,3), (3,4), (5,6)]  # Positions in the maze
fit = [10, 50, 20]  # Fitness scores (closer to goal is better)
selected = roulette_wheel_selection(pop, fit)
print("Selected:", selected)

How it Maps to Q3?

    Maze Solving & 8-Puzzle: Use Tournament or Rank-Based.
    Chess & N-Queens: Use Elitism to preserve top solutions.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Fitness Function Modification

Fitness functions evaluate the quality of a solution.

explain this : 2. Local Search
Local Search refers to an optimization technique used for solving computational
problems where the goal is to find an optimal or near-optimal solution by exploring
neighboring states iteratively. Unlike global search algorithms, which explore the
entire solution space, local search methods work by starting from an initial candidate
solution and iteratively improving it by making small modifications. These algorithms
are particularly useful for problems with large or infinite state spaces.
2.1 Types Of Local Search
1. Hill Climbing: An iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution and
continuously makes small changes to improve it, moving &quot;uphill&quot; in terms of the
objective function. It can get stuck in local maxima, plateaus, or ridges due to its
greedy nature.
2. Simulated Annealing: Inspired by
the annealing process in metallurgy,
this algorithm allows occasional
moves to worse solutions to escape
local optima. It gradually reduces the
likelihood of such moves as the
search progresses, balancing
exploration and exploitation.

3. Genetic Algorithms: A population-based search method inspired by natural
selection, where potential solutions evolve through selection, crossover, and
mutation. It explores multiple paths in parallel, reducing the chances of getting
trapped in local optima.
4. Beam Search: Maintains a limited set of the most promising partial solutions at
each step, expanding them based on a heuristic. Unlike greedy search, it explores
multiple paths simultaneously but with a fixed-width beam to manage memory
and computational cost.
2.1.1 Beam Search
Beam Search is a heuristic search algorithm that navigates a search space by
systematically expanding the most promising nodes within a constrained set. This
approach combines elements of breadth-first search to construct its search tree by
generating all successors at each level. However, it only evaluates and expands a set
number, W, of the best nodes at each level, based on their heuristic values. This
selection process is repeated at each level of the tree. Beam Search explores multiple
paths in parallel but only retains a limited set of top paths at each step.
Key Concepts in Beam Search
1. Beam Width (k): A predefined number that limits how many partial solutions
(or paths) are retained at each level of the search. Larger beam widths explore
more possibilities but require more computation.
2. Heuristic Score: Each path is evaluated based on a heuristic function that
estimates its likelihood or quality.
3. Pruning: Paths that do not make it into the top k at each step are discarded.
Beam Search Algorithm
1. Initialize the beam with the start state.
2. Set the beam width k to a predefined value.
3. While the termination condition is not met:
‚óã Generate all possible successor states for each state in the beam.
‚óã Calculate a heuristic score for each successor state.
‚óã Rank the successor states based on their scores.
‚óã Retain the top k states and discard the rest.
‚óã Update the beam with the retained states.
4. Return the best path based on the final scores.

2.1.2 Hill Climbing Search
Hill Climbing is a heuristic search algorithm used primarily for mathematical
optimization problems in artificial intelligence (AI). It is a form of local search, which
means it focuses on finding the optimal solution by making incremental changes
to an existing solution and then evaluating whether the new solution is better than the
current one. The process is analogous to climbing a hill where you continually seek to
improve your position until you reach the top, or local maximum, from where no further
improvement can be made.
Types of Hill Climbing
1. Simple Hill Climbing: Evaluates each neighbor one by one and moves to the
first better neighbor.
2. Steepest-Ascent Hill Climbing: Evaluates all neighbors and moves to the best
one.
3. Stochastic Hill Climbing: Randomly selects a neighbor and moves to it if it‚Äôs
better.
Simple Hill Climbing Algorithm
1. Start at the initial node and evaluate its heuristic score.
2. Generate one neighboring node at a time.
3. If the neighbor&#39;s score is better than the current node, move to that neighbor,
else generate the next neighbor.
4. If no neighbor has a better score, terminate the search.
5. Return the current node as the solution.
Limitations of Hill Climbing

FAST NUCES - Karachi 7
1. Local Maxima: Can get stuck at a peak that isn‚Äôt the highest.
2. Plateaus: May halt if all neighbors have the same score.
3. Ridges: Can struggle with narrow paths to better solutions.
Solving N-Queens Using Simple Hill Climbing
We aim to place N queens on an N√óN chessboard such that no two queens attack each
other.
1. State Representation: Each row has one queen, and the column position is
stored in a list.
Example for N=4: [1, 3, 0, 2] means:
‚óã Queen in Row 0 is in Column 1.
‚óã Queen in Row 1 is in Column 3, and so on.
2. Heuristic Function: Counts the number of pairs of queens attacking each other.
3. Neighbor Generation: Moves a queen in a row to different columns to create
neighbors.

import random
# Heuristic function: Counts the number of pairs of attacking queens
def calculate_conflicts(state):
print(state)
conflicts = 0

2.1.3 Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithms(GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithms that belong to the
larger part of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms simulate the process of
natural selection which means those species that can adapt to changes in their
environment can survive and reproduce and go to the next generation. In simple words,
they simulate ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest‚Äù among individuals of consecutive generations to
solve a problem.
Key Concepts in Genetic Algorithms
1. Population: A set of candidate solutions
(individuals) to the problem.
2. Fitness Function: A function that
evaluates how good a candidate solution is.
The goal is to maximize or minimize this
function.
3. Selection: The process of choosing the
fittest individuals from the population to
produce offspring.
4. Crossover (Recombination): Combining
parts of two or more parent solutions to
create new offspring.
5. Mutation: Randomly altering parts of a
candidate solution to introduce diversity
into the population.
6. Generations: Iterative steps where the
population evolves over time to produce
better solutions.
Convergence/Termination Criteria
Convergence criteria refer to the conditions or rules that determine when the
algorithm should stop running. These criteria are used to decide whether the algorithm
has found a satisfactory solution or if further iterations (generations) are unlikely to
significantly improve the results.
Common Convergence Criteria in Genetic Algorithms:

National University of Computer &amp; Emerging Sciences - NUCES -

Karachi

FAST School of Computing

FAST NUCES - Karachi 10
1. Maximum Number of Generations:
‚óã The algorithm stops after a predefined number of generations.
‚óã Example: Stop after 1000 generations, regardless of the solution quality.
2. Fitness Threshold:
‚óã The algorithm stops when a solution achieves a fitness value above (or
below, depending on the problem) a specified threshold.
‚óã Example: Stop when the best solution has a fitness score of 95% or
higher.

3. Stagnation (No Improvement):
‚óã The algorithm stops if there is no significant improvement in the best
fitness value over a certain number of generations.
‚óã Example: Stop if the best fitness value hasn‚Äôt improved in the last 50
generations.
4. Population Diversity:
‚óã The algorithm stops if the population becomes too similar (low diversity),
indicating that further exploration is unlikely to yield better solutions.
‚óã Example: Stop if 90% of the population has the same fitness value.
5. Target Solution Found:
‚óã The algorithm stops if a specific target solution is found.
‚óã Example: Stop if a solution matches a predefined configuration or value.

Solving N-Queens Using Genetic Algorithm
Step 1: Define the Problem and Fitness Function
Create a fitness function that counts the number of non-attacking pairs of queens.
‚óè A higher fitness score means fewer conflicts (non-attacking pairs).
‚óè Each queen must be placed in a different column, so the chromosome is a list of
column positions for each row.
import random
# Fitness function: counts non-attacking pairs of queens
def calculate_fitness(individual):
non_attacking_pairs = 0
total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2 # Maximum possible non-attacking pairs
# Check for conflicts
for i in range(n):
for j in range(i + 1, n):
# No same column or diagonal conflict
if individual[i] != individual[j] and abs(individual[i] -
individual[j]) != abs(i - j):
non_attacking_pairs += 1
# Fitness score is the ratio of non-attacking pairs
return non_attacking_pairs / total_pairs

Karachi

FAST School of Computing

FAST NUCES - Karachi 11
Step 2: Initialize the Population
This function generates a random route (a chromosome) by:
‚óè Creating a list of indices representing the unique column position of each queen
in a row (e.g., [3, 0, 2, 1]).
# Generate a random individual (chromosome) based on column positions
def create_random_individual():
return random.sample(range(n), n) # Ensure unique column positions

‚óè This creates an initial population of 10 random boards.
‚óè Each board state is a potential solution, and the population is a collection of these
solutions
# Create an initial population of random individuals
population_size = 10
population = [create_random_individual() for _ in range(population_size)]

Step 3: Evaluate Fitness
‚óè Evaluates the fitness of each board state based on non-attacking pairs.
‚óè In this problem, a higher fitness level is better.
‚óè Fitness_scores is a list containing the fitness score for each board state in the
population.
# Evaluate fitness for each route in the population
fitness_scores = [calculate_fitness(individual) for individual in population]
print(&quot;Fitness Scores:&quot;, fitness_scores)

FAST School of Computing

FAST NUCES - Karachi 12
Step 4: Selection
‚óè Combines fitness scores and population using zip(), pairs each board state with
its fitness score.
‚óè Sorts the population based on fitness (descending) because a higher score is
better.
‚óè Selects the top 50% of the population as parents for the next generation.
‚óè These parents will be used to produce offspring in the next step (crossover).

# Select the best routes (parents) based on fitness
def select_parents(population, fitness_scores):
# Select top 50% of the population
sorted_population = [board for _, board in sorted(zip(fitness_scores,
population), reverse=True)]
return sorted_population[:len(population)//2]
parents = select_parents(population, fitness_scores)
print(&quot;Selected Parents:&quot;, parents)
Step 5: Crossover
‚óè Takes two parents (board) and produces an offspring.
‚óè Randomly selects a subsequence from parent1 (from index start to end).
‚óè Fills the rest of the child using parent2 in the order the queens appear, skipping
any duplicates.
# Crossover function: single-point crossover with unique column
def crossover(parent1, parent2):
point = random.randint(1, n - 2) # Choose a crossover point
child = parent1[:point] + parent2[point:]
# Ensure unique column positions
missing = set(range(n)) - set(child)
duplicates = [col for col in child if child.count(col) &gt; 1]
for i in range(len(child)):
if child.count(child[i]) &gt; 1:
child[i] = missing.pop()
return child

‚óè Selects random pairs of parents from the previously selected parents list.
‚óè Generates population_size offspring through crossover.

parent1, parent2 = random.sample(parents, 2)
child = crossover(parent1, parent2)
new_population.append(child)
print(&quot;New Population after Crossover:&quot;, new_population)
Step 6: Mutation
‚óè Randomly selects two unique indices (idx1 and idx2) from the board.
‚óè Swaps the queens at these two rows.
‚óè Returns the mutated board.
‚óè Since it only swaps existing columns, it preserves uniqueness.
# Randomly swap two locations in a route
def mutate(route):
idx1, idx2 = random.sample(range(n), 2)
individual[idx1], individual[idx2] = individual[idx2], individual[idx1]
return individual
‚óè Loops through each route (child) in the new population.
‚óè Applies mutation with a probability of 0.1 (10%): random.random() generates a
random number between 0 and 1. If it is less than 0.1, mutation is applied.
‚óè If mutation occurs, the board is slightly altered by swapping two queens.

Duty Scheduling Problem Using Genetic Algorithm
A hospital needs to create a weekly shift schedule for its staff, ensuring that there are
enough staff members on duty during peak hours, while also giving each staff member
proper rest.
Step 1: Define the Problem and Fitness Function
This fitness function evaluates the quality of a given shift schedule by calculating a
penalty score based on two key factors:
1. Shift Coverage:
‚óã Checks if each shift has the required number of staff
‚óã If under-staffed, it adds a penalty of 10 per missing staff member for that
shift.
‚óã The penalty increases as coverage becomes worse, making schedules with
poor coverage less fit.
2. Consecutive Shifts:
‚óã Checks if any staff is assigned to back-to-back consecutive shifts (e.g.,
night shift followed by morning shift).
‚óã If a staff member works two consecutive shifts, it adds a penalty of 5 for
each occurrence.
‚óã This discourages overworking employees and promotes work-rest
balance.
import random
# Configuration
num_staff = 5 # Number of employees
num_shifts = 21 # 7 days * 3 shifts per day
max_shifts_per_staff = 7
required_staff_per_shift = 2
population_size = 10
mutation_rate = 0.1
max_generations = 1000
# Fitness function (lower is better)
def evaluate_fitness(schedule):
penalty = 0
# Check shift coverage
for shift in range(num_shifts):
assigned_count = sum(schedule[staff][shift] for staff in
range(num_staff))
if assigned_count &lt; required_staff_per_shift:
penalty += (required_staff_per_shift - assigned_count) * 10 #
Understaffed penalty
# Check consecutive shifts for each staff
for staff in range(num_staff):
for shift in range(num_shifts - 1):
if schedule[staff][shift] == 1 and schedule[staff][shift + 1] ==
1:
penalty += 5 # Penalty for consecutive shifts
return penalty

FAST NUCES - Karachi 16
Step 2: Initialize the Population
This function generates a random schedule (chromosome) as a 2D matrix ‚Üí Rows: Staff,
Columns: Shifts.
‚óè Each cell is 1 if staff is assigned to a shift, otherwise 0.
‚óè Randomly assigns 3 to max_shifts_per_staff shifts to each staff member.
‚óè Returns a valid schedule representing one potential solution.
# Create a random schedule
def create_random_schedule():
schedule = [[0] * num_shifts for _ in range(num_staff)]
for staff in range(num_staff):
assigned_shifts = random.sample(range(num_shifts), random.randint(3,
max_shifts_per_staff))
for shift in assigned_shifts:
schedule[staff][shift] = 1
return schedule

Step 3: Selection
‚óè Combines fitness scores and population using zip(), pairs each schedule with its
fitness score.

‚óè Sorts the population based on fitness (ascending) because a lower penalty is
better.
‚óè Selects the top 50% of the population as parents for the next generation.
‚óè These parents will be used to produce offspring in the next step (crossover).

# Selection (Top 50%)
def select_parents(population, fitness_scores):
sorted_population = [x for _, x in sorted(zip(fitness_scores,
population))]
return sorted_population[:len(population) // 2]
Step 4: Crossover.
‚óè Single-point crossover ‚Üí Combines two parent schedules to create a child.
‚óè Random crossover point is selected across shifts (columns).
‚óè Child inherits shifts before the point from parent1, and after the point from
parent2.
# Crossover (Single point crossover)
def crossover(parent1, parent2):
point = random.randint(0, num_shifts - 1)
child = [parent1[i][:point] + parent2[i][point:] for i in
range(num_staff)]
return child

Local search techniques are optimization methods that focus on iteratively improving a solution by making small modifications to it, rather than searching the entire solution space. They are particularly useful for large or infinite search spaces. Now, let‚Äôs break down the key concepts and map them to the questions that might arise:
1. What is Local Search?

Local search is an optimization approach used in problems where the solution space is too large to explore completely. Instead of evaluating all possible solutions, local search starts with an initial solution and refines it iteratively.
2. Types of Local Search

Each type of local search differs in how it explores the solution space and how it avoids getting stuck in suboptimal solutions.
2.1 Hill Climbing

    Concept: Starts with an arbitrary solution and keeps making small changes to improve it.
    Example Question: What is the main limitation of hill climbing?
    Answer: Hill climbing can get stuck in local maxima (where no small change improves the solution), plateaus (flat regions where progress halts), or ridges (narrow paths to better solutions).

2.2 Simulated Annealing

    Concept: Inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, it sometimes accepts worse solutions to escape local optima.
    Example Question: How does simulated annealing avoid local maxima?
    Answer: It allows occasional downhill moves based on a probability function that decreases over time, gradually focusing more on exploitation than exploration.

2.3 Genetic Algorithms

    Concept: Inspired by natural selection, it evolves solutions using selection, crossover, and mutation.
    Example Question: What role does mutation play in a genetic algorithm?
    Answer: Mutation introduces random variations to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence.

2.4 Beam Search

    Concept: Keeps a limited set of the best solutions at each step instead of evaluating all possibilities.
    Example Question: How does beam search differ from greedy search?
    Answer: Greedy search follows one best path, while beam search keeps multiple promising paths, reducing the risk of missing the global optimum.

3. Beam Search Algorithm

    Example Question: What is the beam width in beam search?
    Answer: The beam width (k) is the number of top candidates retained at each level of the search.

Python Code Example:

import heapq

graph = {
    'S': [('A', 3), ('B', 6), ('C', 5)],
    'A': [('D', 9), ('E', 8)],
    'B': [('F', 12), ('G', 14)],
    'C': [('H', 7)],
    'H': [('I', 5), ('J', 6)],
    'I': [('K', 1), ('L', 10), ('M', 2)],
    'D': [], 'E': [], 'F': [], 'G': [], 'J': [], 'K': [], 'L': [], 'M': []
}

def beam_search(start, goal, beam_width=2):
    beam = [(0, [start])]  # (cumulative cost, path)
    
    while beam:
        candidates = []
        for cost, path in beam:
            current_node = path[-1]
            if current_node == goal:
                return path, cost  # Return the path and cost if goal is found
            for neighbor, edge_cost in graph.get(current_node, []):
                new_cost = cost + edge_cost
                new_path = path + [neighbor]
                candidates.append((new_cost, new_path))
        
        beam = heapq.nsmallest(beam_width, candidates, key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    return None, float('inf')

start_node = 'S'
goal_node = 'L'
beam_width = 3
path, cost = beam_search(start=start_node, goal=goal_node, beam_width=beam_width)
print(f"Path found: {' ‚Üí '.join(path)} with total cost: {cost}" if path else "No path found.")

4. Hill Climbing Search

Hill climbing is an optimization technique where the algorithm moves toward the highest value (or lowest cost) solution by making small modifications.

    Example Question: How does steepest-ascent hill climbing differ from simple hill climbing?
    Answer: Simple hill climbing picks the first better neighbor, while steepest-ascent hill climbing evaluates all neighbors and picks the best one.

Python Code Example for N-Queens (Hill Climbing):

import random

def calculate_conflicts(state):
    conflicts = 0
    n = len(state)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if state[i] == state[j] or abs(state[i] - state[j]) == abs(i - j):
                conflicts += 1
    return conflicts

def get_neighbors(state):
    neighbors = []
    n = len(state)
    for row in range(n):
        for col in range(n):
            if col != state[row]:
                new_state = list(state)
                new_state[row] = col
                neighbors.append(new_state)
    return neighbors

def simple_hill_climbing(n):
    current_state = [random.randint(0, n - 1) for _ in range(n)]
    current_conflicts = calculate_conflicts(current_state)
    
    while True:
        neighbors = get_neighbors(current_state)
        next_state = None
        next_conflicts = current_conflicts
        
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            neighbor_conflicts = calculate_conflicts(neighbor)
            if neighbor_conflicts < next_conflicts:
                next_state = neighbor
                next_conflicts = neighbor_conflicts
                break  # Move to the first better neighbor
        
        if next_conflicts >= current_conflicts:
            break
        
        current_state = next_state
        current_conflicts = next_conflicts
    
    return current_state, current_conflicts

n = 8
solution, conflicts = simple_hill_climbing(n)
if conflicts == 0:
    print(f"Solution found for {n}-Queens problem: {solution}")
else:
    print(f"Could not find a solution. Stuck at state with {conflicts} conflicts: {solution}")

5. Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms (GA) mimic evolution to optimize solutions by applying selection, crossover, and mutation.

    Example Question: What is the role of the fitness function in a genetic algorithm?
    Answer: The fitness function evaluates how good a candidate solution is, guiding selection.

Final Summary
Search Type	Key Feature	Main Challenge
Hill Climbing	Greedy, makes local improvements	Gets stuck in local maxima
Simulated Annealing	Allows worse moves to escape local optima	Needs careful cooling schedule
Genetic Algorithm	Uses selection, crossover, and mutation	May converge too slowly

Local Search - A Simple Explanation
What is Local Search?

Local Search is an optimization technique used to find the best (or nearly best) solution for a problem by making small, step-by-step improvements. Instead of checking every possible solution (which is what global search does), local search starts with one solution and keeps tweaking it to get better results.

It's useful for problems that have huge or infinite possible solutions, where checking everything would take too long.
2.1 Types of Local Search
1. Hill Climbing

Think of climbing a mountain. You always take a step that goes uphill (improving the solution).

How it works:

    Start with any random solution.
    Check all nearby solutions.
    Move to the one that improves the solution the most.
    Repeat until you reach a peak (local maximum).

üö® Problems with Hill Climbing:

    Local Maxima: Gets stuck on a peak that is not the highest.
    Plateaus: Gets stuck in a flat area where no step improves the solution.
    Ridges: Might struggle if the best path is a narrow upward path.

2. Simulated Annealing

Inspired by metal cooling (annealing in metallurgy). Sometimes, taking a worse step helps escape local maxima and find a better overall solution.

How it works:

    Start with a random solution.
    Sometimes, move to a worse solution to escape traps.
    Slowly reduce bad moves as you get closer to the solution.

üî• Advantage: Can escape local maxima and find a better solution!
3. Genetic Algorithms (GA)

Inspired by evolution (survival of the fittest). Instead of one solution, GA keeps a group (population) of solutions and improves them over time.

How it works:

    Population: Start with a group of random solutions.
    Fitness Function: Check how good each solution is.
    Selection: Pick the best solutions.
    Crossover: Mix two solutions to create new ones.
    Mutation: Make small random changes.
    Repeat until you find the best solution!

üí° Advantage: Explores many possible solutions at the same time.
4. Beam Search

A smarter version of breadth-first search where we only keep the best few paths instead of exploring everything.

How it works:

    Start with an initial state.
    Keep the top k best solutions.
    Expand these solutions.
    Keep only the best k solutions.
    Repeat until the goal is found.

üöÄ Advantage: Faster and less memory-consuming than brute-force search.
2.1.1 Beam Search - Key Concepts
1. Beam Width (k):

How many best solutions to keep at each step?

    Larger k = More exploration but slower.
    Smaller k = Faster but may miss the best solution.

2. Heuristic Score:

How good is a solution? The algorithm picks solutions with the best scores.
3. Pruning:

Bad solutions are removed, keeping only the top k.
Beam Search Algorithm:

    Start with the initial state.
    Set beam width k.
    Expand all possible next states.
    Keep the top k best states.
    Repeat until the best solution is found.

    'D': [], 'E': [], 'F': [], 'G': [],
    'J': [], 'K': [], 'L': [], 'M': []
}

def beam_search(start, goal, beam_width=2):
    beam = [(0, [start])]  # (cost, path)
    while beam:
        candidates = []
        for cost, path in beam:
            current_node = path[-1]
            if current_node == goal:
                return path, cost  # Found the goal
            for neighbor, edge_cost in graph.get(current_node, []):
                new_cost = cost + edge_cost
                new_path = path + [neighbor]
                candidates.append((new_cost, new_path))
        beam = heapq.nsmallest(beam_width, candidates, key=lambda x: x[0])
    return None, float('inf')  # No path found

start_node, goal_node = 'S', 'L'
path, cost = beam_search(start_node, goal_node, beam_width=3)

if path:
    print(f"Path found: {' ‚Üí '.join(path)} with total cost: {cost}")
else:
    print("No path found.")

2.1.2 Hill Climbing - Detailed Explanation

Used in AI & optimization problems.

üöÄ Example: N-Queens Problem (placing queens on a chessboard without attacking each other).
Types of Hill Climbing:

    Simple Hill Climbing: Checks one neighbor at a time.
    Steepest-Ascent: Checks all neighbors and moves to the best one.
    Stochastic: Picks a random neighbor and moves if it's better.

Hill Climbing Algorithm:

    Start with an initial state.
    Generate neighboring states.
    Move to a better neighbor.

Let's break it down and solve the entire question step by step.
Q1: Define the architecture of a goal-based agent and environment class.
Goal-Based Agent Architecture:

A goal-based agent takes actions to reach a specific goal. Unlike reflex agents that react to immediate conditions, goal-based agents use search algorithms (like BFS and DFS) to determine the best sequence of actions.

    Perception: The agent observes the environment through sensors.
    State Representation: The agent maintains an internal representation of the world.
    Goal Specification: The agent has a well-defined goal (e.g., reaching a key in a maze).
    Action Selection: The agent decides actions using a search algorithm (like BFS).
    Execution: The agent executes the selected action.

Environment Class:

The environment is the world where the agent operates. It defines:

    State Space: The grid and obstacles.
    Actions: Possible moves (up, down, left, right).
    Transition Model: How actions change the agent's position.
    Goal Test: Determines if the agent reached the goal.

Q2: Implement BFS within the agent class.

We'll implement BFS to find the shortest path from S (Start) to K (Key) in the given grid.
Python Code:

from collections import deque

class Environment:
    def __init__(self, grid):
        self.grid = grid
        self.rows = len(grid)
        self.cols = len(grid[0])
        self.start = None
        self.goal = None
        self.find_positions()

    def find_positions(self):
        """Find the start (S) and goal (K) positions in the grid."""
        for r in range(self.rows):
            for c in range(self.cols):
                if self.grid[r][c] == 'S':
                    self.start = (r, c)
                elif self.grid[r][c] == 'K':
                    self.goal = (r, c)

class GoalBasedAgent:
    def __init__(self, environment):
        self.env = environment
        self.directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Up, Down, Left, Right

    def bfs(self):
        """Finds the shortest path using BFS."""
        queue = deque([(self.env.start, [])])  # (position, path taken)
        visited = set()
        visited.add(self.env.start)

        while queue:
            (x, y), path = queue.popleft()

            if (x, y) == self.env.goal:
                return path + [(x, y)]  # Return the complete path

            for dx, dy in self.directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < self.env.rows and 0 <= ny < self.env.cols:
                    if (nx, ny) not in visited and self.env.grid[nx][ny] != '#':
                        queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [(x, y)]))
                        visited.add((nx, ny))

        return None  # No path found

# Define the given grid
grid = [
    ['S', '.', '#', '.', 'K'],
    ['#', '#', '.', '#', '#'],
    ['#', '#', '#', '#', '.']
]

# Create environment and agent
env = Environment(grid)
agent = GoalBasedAgent(env)

# Find path using BFS
path = agent.bfs()
print("Shortest Path to Key:", path)

Explanation of the BFS Implementation:

    Environment Class:
        Reads the grid.
        Finds the start S and goal K positions.

    Goal-Based Agent Class:
        Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the shortest path.
        Stores visited positions to avoid loops.
        Expands neighbors in four possible directions.

    Execution of BFS:
        Uses a queue to explore paths level by level.
        Stops when reaching K and returns the shortest path.

Output Example:

Shortest Path to Key: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4)]

This means the agent moves:

    From (0,0) (S) ‚Üí Right (0,1)
    Then (0,1) ‚Üí Right (0,3)
    Finally (0,3) ‚Üí Right (0,4) (K)

Question 1: Goal-Based Agent & BFS Implementation
1. Define the architecture of a goal-based agent and environment class

A goal-based agent is an AI agent that takes actions to achieve a specific goal. It uses search algorithms like BFS, DFS, A, or Greedy BFS* to determine the best path to reach the goal.
Key Components of a Goal-Based Agent:

    Perception: The agent observes the environment.
    State Representation: It stores information about the current position and obstacles.
    Goal State: The desired location (finding the key in the maze).
    Action Selection: It decides whether to move up, down, left, or right.
    Search Algorithm: It finds the optimal path to the goal.

Environment Class:

The environment defines the maze structure and movement rules.
2. Implement BFS within the Agent Class

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph search algorithm that explores the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

# Run BFS
env = Environment(maze)
agent = Agent(env)
path = agent.bfs()

if path:
    print("Shortest Path:", path)
else:
    print("No path found")

‚úÖ Explanation:

    The Environment class initializes the maze and defines valid moves.
    The Agent class implements BFS to find the shortest path.
    The BFS function explores the maze level by level, ensuring the shortest path to the key.

Question 2: Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) Algorithm
1. Define the Manhattan Distance Heuristic

Manhattan distance is used to estimate the shortest path between two points in a grid.
Formula:
d=‚à£x1‚àíx2‚à£+‚à£y1‚àíy2‚à£
d=‚à£x1‚àíx2‚à£+‚à£y1‚àíy2‚à£

def manhattan_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)

2. Generate Neighbours Function

This function returns all possible valid moves.

def generate_neighbours(x, y, env):
    directions = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]  
    neighbours = []
    for dx, dy in directions:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if env.is_valid(nx, ny):
            neighbours.append((nx, ny))
    return neighbours

3. Implement GBFS Algorithm

Greedy Best-First Search prioritizes moves based on the heuristic Manhattan distance.

import heapq

class GreedyBFS:
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.env = env

    def gbfs(self):
        start = self.env.start
        goal = self.env.goal
        priority_queue = [(manhattan_distance(*start, *goal), start, [start])]
        visited = set([start])

        while priority_queue:
            _, (x, y), path = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
            if (x, y) == goal:
                return path

            for nx, ny in generate_neighbours(x, y, self.env):
                if (nx, ny) not in visited:
                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (manhattan_distance(nx, ny, *goal), (nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))
                    visited.add((nx, ny))

        return None  # No path found

# Run GBFS
gbfs_agent = GreedyBFS(env)
gbfs_path = gbfs_agent.gbfs()
print("GBFS Path:", gbfs_path)

‚úÖ Explanation:

    Uses a priority queue to always expand the node closest to the goal.
    Faster than BFS but not always optimal.

Question 3: Genetic Algorithm for Book Arrangement
1. Initial Population Function

Creates a random set of possible book arrangements.

import random

def initial_population(size, num_books):
    return [random.sample(range(num_books), num_books) for _ in range(size)]

2. Roulette Selection Function

Higher fitness solutions have higher probability of selection.

import numpy as np

def roulette_selection(population, fitness):
    total_fitness = sum(fitness)
    probabilities = [f/total_fitness for f in fitness]
    return population[np.random.choice(len(population), p=probabilities)]

3. Single-Point Crossover Function

def single_point_crossover(parent1, parent2):
    point = random.randint(1, len(parent1)-1)
    return parent1[:point] + parent2[point:], parent2[:point] + parent1[point:]

4. Mutation Function (Binary Mutation)

def binary_mutation(individual):
    index = random.randint(0, len(individual) - 1)
    individual[index] = random.randint(0, len(individual) - 1)
    return individual

5. Full GA Implementation

def genetic_algorithm():
    population = initial_population(10, 5)  # 10 individuals, 5 books
    for _ in range(50):  # Run for 50 generations
        fitness = [evaluate(ind) for ind in population]  
        new_population = []
        
        for _ in range(len(population) // 2):
            parent1, parent2 = roulette_selection(population, fitness), roulette_selection(population, fitness)
            child1, child2 = single_point_crossover(parent1, parent2)
            new_population.extend([binary_mutation(child1), binary_mutation(child2)])
        
        population = new_population

    best_solution = max(population, key=evaluate)
    return best_solution

print("Best Book Arrangement:", genetic_algorithm())

‚úÖ Explanation:

    Generates an initial population.
    Roulette Selection picks parents.
    Crossover creates children.
    Mutation introduces randomness.
    Runs 50 generations to find the best book arrangement.

Final Notes

    BFS is best for shortest paths.
    GBFS is heuristic-based but may get stuck in local optima.
    Genetic Algorithms optimize problems using evolution.

Here are the complete solutions to your AI midterm questions:
Question 1: Goal-Based Agent and BFS Implementation
1. Define the architecture of a goal-based agent and environment class.

A goal-based agent makes decisions based on achieving a specific goal. It evaluates different sequences of actions and selects the one that leads to the goal most efficiently.
Architecture of a Goal-Based Agent

    Perception: The agent perceives the environment using sensors.
    State Representation: The agent maintains an internal representation of the environment.
    Goal Definition: The agent has a well-defined goal state.
    Search & Planning: The agent evaluates different action sequences to reach the goal.
    Action Execution: The best action sequence is executed using actuators.

Implementation of BFS within the Agent Class

from collections import deque

class Environment:
    def __init__(self, grid):
        self.grid = grid
        self.start = (0, 0)
        self.goal = (0, 4)
        self.directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up

    def is_valid_move(self, x, y):
        return 0 <= x < len(self.grid) and 0 <= y < len(self.grid[0]) and self.grid[x][y] != '#'

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, environment):
        self.env = environment

    def bfs(self):
        queue = deque([(self.env.start, [self.env.start])])
        visited = set()

        while queue:
            (x, y), path = queue.popleft()
            if (x, y) == self.env.goal:
                return path

            visited.add((x, y))
            for dx, dy in self.env.directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if self.env.is_valid_move(nx, ny) and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                    queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))

        return None  # No path found

# Define the grid
grid = [
    ['S', '.', '#', '.', 'K'],
    ['.', '#', '#', '#', '.'],
    ['#', '#', '.', '#', '#']
]

env = Environment(grid)
agent = Agent(env)
path = agent.bfs()

print("Shortest path:", path)

Question 2: Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) Implementation
1. Define the Manhattan heuristic function.

def manhattan_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)

2. Generate Neighbors Function

def generate_neighbors(grid, x, y):
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    neighbors = []
    
    for dx, dy in directions:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] != '#':
            neighbors.append((nx, ny))
    
    return neighbors

3. Implementing Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)

import heapq

def gbfs(grid, start, goal):
    priority_queue = []
    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (manhattan_distance(*start, *goal), start))
    visited = set()
    path = {start: None}

    while priority_queue:
        _, (x, y) = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        if (x, y) == goal:
            result_path = []
            while (x, y) is not None:
                result_path.append((x, y))
                (x, y) = path[(x, y)]
            return result_path[::-1]

        visited.add((x, y))
        for neighbor in generate_neighbors(grid, x, y):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (manhattan_distance(*neighbor, *goal), neighbor))
                path[neighbor] = (x, y)

    return None  # No path found

# Example Usage
grid = [
    ['S', '.', '#', '.', 'K'],
    ['.', '#', '#', '#', '.'],
    ['#', '#', '.', '#', '#']
]

start = (0, 0)
goal = (0, 4)
shortest_path = gbfs(grid, start, goal)
print("GBFS Path:", shortest_path)

Question 3: Genetic Algorithm for Optimization
1. Define Initial Population

import random

def generate_population(size, bit_length):
    return [random.randint(0, (1 << bit_length) - 1) for _ in range(size)]

2. Selection Function (Roulette Wheel Selection)

def fitness(x):
    return x**2 - 1

def roulette_selection(population):
    total_fitness = sum(fitness(x) for x in population)
    probabilities = [fitness(x) / total_fitness for x in population]
    return random.choices(population, weights=probabilities, k=2)

3. Crossover Function (Single-Point Crossover)

def single_point_crossover(parent1, parent2):
    point = random.randint(1, 4)
    mask = (1 << point) - 1
    child1 = (parent1 & ~mask) | (parent2 & mask)
    child2 = (parent2 & ~mask) | (parent1 & mask)
    return child1, child2

4. Mutation Function (Binary Mutation)

def mutate(individual, mutation_rate=0.1):
    if random.random() < mutation_rate:
        bit = random.randint(0, 4)
        individual ^= (1 << bit)  # Flip the bit
    return individual

5. Running the Genetic Algorithm

def genetic_algorithm(pop_size=10, generations=50, mutation_rate=0.1):
    population = generate_population(pop_size, 5)

    for _ in range(generations):
        new_population = []
        for _ in range(pop_size // 2):
            parent1, parent2 = roulette_selection(population)
            child1, child2 = single_point_crossover(parent1, parent2)
            new_population.extend([mutate(child1, mutation_rate), mutate(child2, mutation_rate)])

        population = sorted(new_population, key=fitness, reverse=True)[:pop_size]

    best_solution = max(population, key=fitness)
    return best_solution, fitness(best_solution)

best_x, best_fx = genetic_algorithm()

Solution to AI Lab Mid Exam ‚Äì Paper B
Question 1: Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) in a Warehouse
1. Define the architecture of a goal-based robot agent and warehouse environment

A goal-based agent is designed to take actions based on achieving a specific goal. In this problem, the agent (robot) must retrieve a package by navigating through racks, which are represented as nodes in an unweighted graph.
Agent and Environment Architecture:

    Perception: The robot detects nearby racks and possible paths.
    State Representation: The warehouse is represented as a graph where nodes are racks and edges are paths.
    Goal-Based Planning: The robot searches for a path to the goal rack using Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS).
    Action Execution: The robot moves along the computed shortest path.

class WarehouseEnvironment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {
            'R1': ['R2', 'R4'],
            'R2': ['R1', 'R3', 'R5'],
            'R3': ['R2', 'R6'],
            'R4': ['R1', 'R5', 'R7'],
            'R5': ['R2', 'R4', 'R6', 'R8'],
            'R6': ['R3', 'R5', 'R9'],
            'R7': ['R4', 'R8'],
            'R8': ['R5', 'R7', 'R9'],
            'R9': ['R6', 'R8']
        }
        self.start = 'R1'
        self.goal = 'R8'

2. Implement IDDFS to Find the Shortest Path

Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) combines the depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) approaches by running DFS with increasing depth limits.

def depth_limited_search(graph, node, goal, limit, path, visited):
    if node == goal:
        return path
    if limit <= 0:
        return None

    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:

2. Generate Neighbours

The player can move up, down, left, or right, avoiding obstacles (#).

def generate_neighbours(grid, position):
    x, y = position
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])

            neighbours.append((nx, ny))

    return neighbours

3. Implement Best-First Search (GBFS)

We use a priority queue (Min-Heap) to always expand the node with the smallest Euclidean distance.

import heapq

def best_first_search(grid, start, goal):
    priority_queue = []
    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (euclidean_distance(*start, *goal), start))

Task 2: Genetic Algorithm for 0/1 Knapsack Problem

Create an initial set of candidate solutions.

def initialize_population(pop_size, num_items):
    return [create_random_individual(num_items) for _ in range(pop_size)]

3. Tournament Selection

Instead of selecting the top 50%, we randomly pick three individuals and choose the one with the highest fitness.

def tournament_selection(population, fitness_scores):
    selected = random.sample(range(len(population)), 3)  # Pick 3 random individuals
    best_individual = max(selected, key=lambda idx: fitness_scores[idx])
    return population[best_individual]

4. Two-Point Crossover

Select two random crossover points and swap segments.

    if len(parent1) < 2:  
        return parent1, parent2  

    point1, point2 = sorted(random.sample(range(len(parent1)), 2))  # Pick 2 crossover points

Question 1: Uniform Cost Search (UCS) for Pathfinding in a Weighted Graph

In this problem, a city is modeled as a weighted graph, where intersections are nodes and roads are edges with varying costs (distances).
Our task is to find the least-cost path from A to I using Uniform Cost Search (UCS).
1. Define the Architecture of a Goal-Based Agent

A goal-based agent follows a structured approach to reach a specific target using search algorithms. The architecture consists of:

    Perception: The agent detects intersections (nodes) and roads (edges).
    State Space: A graph where nodes represent locations, and edges represent roads with associated costs.
    Search Algorithm: Uses Uniform Cost Search (UCS) to find the shortest path based on actual travel costs.
    Goal Test: The agent stops when it reaches the destination node (I).
    Actions: The agent chooses the lowest-cost path at each step.

2. Implement Uniform Cost Search (UCS)

UCS is a priority queue-based search algorithm that expands the least-cost node first.

import heapq

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}

    def add_edge(self, node1, node2, cost):
        if node1 not in self.graph:
            self.graph[node1] = []
        if node2 not in self.graph:
            self.graph[node2] = []
        self.graph[node1].append((node2, cost))
        self.graph[node2].append((node1, cost))  # Assuming undirected graph

    def uniform_cost_search(self, start, goal):
        priority_queue = []
        heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (0, start, []))  # (cost, node, path)
        visited = set()

        while priority_queue:
            cost, node, path = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

            if node in visited:
                continue

            path = path + [node]
            visited.add(node)

            if node == goal:
                return path, cost  # Return path and total cost

            for neighbor, edge_cost in self.graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (cost + edge_cost, neighbor, path))

        return None, float('inf')  # No path found

3. Simulate the Agent in the Environment

def run_agent():
    city_graph = Graph()
    city_graph.add_edge('A', 'B', 4)
    city_graph.add_edge('A', 'C', 3)
    city_graph.add_edge('B', 'D', 2)
    city_graph.add_edge('C', 'D', 1)
    city_graph.add_edge('C', 'E', 6)
    city_graph.add_edge('D', 'F', 5)
    city_graph.add_edge('E', 'G', 2)
    city_graph.add_edge('F', 'H', 3)
    city_graph.add_edge('G', 'I', 4)
    city_graph.add_edge('H', 'I', 2)

    start, goal = 'A', 'I'
    path, total_cost = city_graph.uniform_cost_search(start, goal)

    if path:
        print("Least-Cost Path:", path)
        print("Total Cost:", total_cost)
    else:
        print("No path found.")

run_agent()

Expected Output:

Least-Cost Path: ['A', 'C', 'D', 'F', 'H', 'I']
Total Cost: 11

Question 2: A Search for Rover Navigation*

The rover needs to reach the energy module (E) while avoiding obstacles (#).
Manhattan Distance is used as the heuristic and actual movement cost as the path cost.
1. Define Manhattan Distance Heuristic

For two points (x1,y1)(x1‚Äã,y1‚Äã) and (x2,y2)(x2‚Äã,y2‚Äã):
h(x,y)=‚à£x2‚àíx1‚à£+‚à£y2‚àíy1‚à£
h(x,y)=‚à£x2‚Äã‚àíx1‚Äã‚à£+‚à£y2‚Äã‚àíy1‚Äã‚à£

def manhattan_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return abs(x2 - x1) + abs(y2 - y1)

2. Implement A Search*

A* search uses f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where:

    g(n) = actual movement cost
    h(n) = Manhattan distance

def a_star_search(grid, start, goal):
    priority_queue = []
    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (0, start))
    came_from = {start: None}

    while priority_queue:
        _, current = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        x, y = current
        
        if current == goal:

                path.append(current)
                current = came_from[current]
            return path[::-1], cost_so_far[goal]
        
        for dx, dy in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]:  # Right, Down, Left, Up
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] != '#':
                new_cost = cost_so_far[(x, y)] + 1  
                if (nx, ny) not in cost_so_far or new_cost < cost_so_far[(nx, ny)]:
                    cost_so_far[(nx, ny)] = new_cost
                    priority = new_cost + manhattan_distance(nx, ny, *goal)
                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (priority, (nx, ny)))
                    came_from[(nx, ny)] = (x, y)
    
    return None, float('inf')  # No path found

3. Simulate the Rover

def run_rover():
    grid = [
        ['S', '.', '#', '.', 'E'],
        ['#', '.', '#', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '#', '#', '.', '#'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '#', '.'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '#', '.']
    ]

    start, goal = (0, 0), (0, 4)  # 'S' = (0,0), 'E' = (0,4)
    path, total_cost = a_star_search(grid, start, goal)

    if path:
        print("Optimal Path:", path)
        print("Total Cost:", total_cost)
    else:
        print("No path found.")

run_rover()

Expected Output:

Total Cost: 10

2. Depth-First Search (DFS) in a 2D Grid

Problem:

    Similar to BFS but explores deeper paths first.
    DFS does not guarantee the shortest path.

def dfs(grid, start, end):

                visited.add((nx, ny))

    return None  # No path found

path = dfs(grid, start, end)
print("DFS Path:", path)

3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS) in a Graph

Problem:

    Each edge has a cost.
    UCS finds the least-cost path from A to E.

import heapq

def ucs(graph, start, goal):
    pq = [(0, start, [])]  # (cost, current_node, path)
    visited = set()

    while pq:
        cost, node, path = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        path = path + [node]

        if node == goal:
            return path, cost  # Return path and cost

        for neighbor, edge_cost in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(pq, (cost + edge_cost, neighbor, path))

    return None, float('inf')

# Example Graph

Q2: Informed Search Algorithms (Greedy BFS, A)*

We will implement Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and A Search (A-Star)* in a 2D grid where an agent must navigate from a starting position S to the goal E. Obstacles are represented by #.
1. Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)

üìå Concept:

    Uses a heuristic function (e.g., Manhattan Distance) to prioritize nodes.
    Does not consider actual movement cost, so it may get stuck in suboptimal paths.

import heapq

def manhattan_distance(a, b):
    return abs(a[0] - b[0]) + abs(a[1] - b[1])  # |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|

def greedy_best_first_search(grid, start, end):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    pq = [(manhattan_distance(start, end), start, [start])]  # (heuristic, current_position, path)
    visited = set([start])

    while pq:
        _, (x, y), path = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if (x, y) == end:
            return path  # Return the path found

        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] != "#" and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(pq, (manhattan_distance((nx, ny), end), (nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))
                visited.add((nx, ny))

    return None  # No path found

# Example Grid
grid = [
    ['S', '.', '#', '.', 'E'],
    ['.', '#', '.', '.', '.'],
    ['.', '#', '#', '.', '#'],
    ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
]

start, end = (0, 0), (0, 4)
path = greedy_best_first_search(grid, start, end)
print("Greedy BFS Path:", path)

2. A (A-Star) Search Algorithm*

üìå Concept:

    Uses both heuristic (h) and actual cost (g) ‚Üí f(n) = g(n) + h(n).
    Guarantees the shortest path.

def a_star_search(grid, start, end):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    pq = [(0 + manhattan_distance(start, end), 0, start, [start])]  # (f, g, current_position, path)
    visited = set()

    while pq:
        _, g, (x, y), path = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if (x, y) == end:
            return path, g  # Return shortest path and cost

        if (x, y) in visited:
            continue
        visited.add((x, y))

        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] != "#" and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                new_g = g + 1  # Each step has a cost of 1
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_g + manhattan_distance((nx, ny), end), new_g, (nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))

    return None, float('inf')  # No path found

path, cost = a_star_search(grid, start, end)
print("A* Path:", path, "Total Cost:", cost)

ChatGPT said:
Q3: Genetic Algorithm (GA) - 0/1 Knapsack Problem

We will implement a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem while exploring different selection and crossover methods.
üìå Problem Statement

A logistics company wants to optimize its truck space by selecting the most valuable set of packages that fit within a given weight limit. Each package has a weight and value, and our goal is to maximize total value while ensuring the total weight does not exceed the truck's capacity.

üìù Genetic Algorithm Approach:

    Chromosomes ‚Üí Represented as binary strings (1 = include item, 0 = exclude item).
    Fitness Function ‚Üí Maximizes the total value while staying under the weight limit.
    Selection Methods ‚Üí Different ways to pick parents (Roulette, Tournament, Rank-Based, Elitism).
    Crossover Techniques ‚Üí Methods to combine parents and generate offspring (Single-Point, Two-Point, Uniform, PMX, OX).

üõ† Step 1: Define Problem Data

import random

# Example items (weight, value)
items = [
    (2, 10),  # Item 1: weight=2, value=10
    (3, 20),  # Item 2: weight=3, value=20
    (4, 30),  # Item 3: weight=4, value=30
    (5, 40),  # Item 4: weight=5, value=40
]

# Truck weight limit
capacity = 7

üõ† Step 2: Chromosome Representation & Initialization

A chromosome is a binary string representing the inclusion/exclusion of items.

# Generate a random binary chromosome (1 = include item, 0 = exclude item)
def create_random_individual(num_items):
    return [random.choice([0, 1]) for _ in range(num_items)]

# Initialize population with random chromosomes
def initialize_population(pop_size, num_items):
    return [create_random_individual(num_items) for _ in range(pop_size)]

üõ† Step 3: Fitness Function

The fitness function calculates the total value of selected items while ensuring that the total weight does not exceed the truck‚Äôs capacity.

def fitness_function(individual):
    total_weight = 0
    total_value = 0
    
    for i, gene in enumerate(individual):
        if gene == 1:  # If item is included
            total_weight += items[i][0]  # Add weight
            total_value += items[i][1]  # Add value
    
    if total_weight > capacity:
        return 0  # Penalize overweight solutions
    return total_value  # Maximize value

üõ† Step 4: Selection Methods
1. Roulette Wheel Selection

Probabilistically selects parents based on their fitness.

def roulette_wheel_selection(population, fitness_scores):
    total_fitness = sum(fitness_scores)
    pick = random.uniform(0, total_fitness)
    current = 0

    for i, individual in enumerate(population):
        current += fitness_scores[i]
        if current >= pick:
            return individual

2. Tournament Selection

Randomly selects a few individuals and chooses the best one.

def tournament_selection(population, fitness_scores, tournament_size=3):
    selected = random.sample(list(zip(population, fitness_scores)), tournament_size)
    return max(selected, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]  # Return the best individual

üõ† Step 5: Crossover Methods
1. Single-Point Crossover

Splits parents at a single random point and swaps parts.

def single_point_crossover(parent1, parent2):
    point = random.randint(1, len(parent1) - 1)
    child1 = parent1[:point] + parent2[point:]
    child2 = parent2[:point] + parent1[point:]
    return child1, child2

2. Two-Point Crossover

Swaps segments between two random points.

def two_point_crossover(parent1, parent2):
    p1, p2 = sorted(random.sample(range(1, len(parent1)), 2))
    child1 = parent1[:p1] + parent2[p1:p2] + parent1[p2:]
    child2 = parent2[:p1] + parent1[p1:p2] + parent2[p2:]
    return child1, child2

3. Uniform Crossover

Each gene is chosen randomly from either parent.

def uniform_crossover(parent1, parent2):
    child1, child2 = [], []
    for i in range(len(parent1)):
        if random.random() < 0.5:
            child1.append(parent1[i])
            child2.append(parent2[i])
        else:
            child1.append(parent2[i])
            child2.append(parent1[i])
    return child1, child2

üõ† Step 6: Mutation

Randomly flips a gene with a small probability.

def mutate(individual, mutation_rate=0.1):
    return [gene if random.random() > mutation_rate else 1 - gene for gene in individual]

üõ† Step 7: Genetic Algorithm Execution

def genetic_algorithm(
    pop_size=10, generations=50, crossover_method="single_point", selection_method="roulette"
):
    population = initialize_population(pop_size, len(items))

    for gen in range(generations):
        # Evaluate fitness
        fitness_scores = [fitness_function(ind) for ind in population]

        # Selection
        if selection_method == "roulette":
            parents = [roulette_wheel_selection(population, fitness_scores) for _ in range(pop_size)]
        elif selection_method == "tournament":
            parents = [tournament_selection(population, fitness_scores) for _ in range(pop_size)]
        
        # Crossover
        next_generation = []
        for i in range(0, pop_size, 2):
            if crossover_method == "single_point":
                child1, child2 = single_point_crossover(parents[i], parents[i+1])
            elif crossover_method == "two_point":
                child1, child2 = two_point_crossover(parents[i], parents[i+1])
            elif crossover_method == "uniform":
                child1, child2 = uniform_crossover(parents[i], parents[i+1])
            
            next_generation.extend([mutate(child1), mutate(child2)])

        # Update population
        population = next_generation

    # Return the best solution
    fitness_scores = [fitness_function(ind) for ind in population]
    best_index = fitness_scores.index(max(fitness_scores))
    return population[best_index], max(fitness_scores)

# Run GA
best_solution, best_fitness = genetic_algorithm()
print("Best Solution:", best_solution, "Max Value:", best_fitness)

üí° Now you have a fully working GA! üéâ Want me to modify it for another problem like N-Queens or Maze Solving?
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Q3: Genetic Algorithm for N-Queens Problem üëë‚ôüÔ∏è

The N-Queens Problem is a classic AI puzzle where N queens must be placed on an N √ó N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other (i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).

We will solve this problem using a Genetic Algorithm (GA).
üìå Problem Representation

Instead of using a 2D board, we represent a solution as a 1D array of size N where:

    The index of the array represents the column.
    The value at each index represents the row where the queen is placed.

For N = 4, an example chromosome:
[2, 4, 1, 3] means:

    Queen in column 1 is in row 2.
    Queen in column 2 is in row 4.
    Queen in column 3 is in row 1.
    Queen in column 4 is in row 3.

üõ† Step 1: Fitness Function

The goal is to minimize the number of conflicts (attacks).
A perfect solution has 0 conflicts.

def fitness_function(board):
    """Calculates number of non-attacking queen pairs"""
    n = len(board)
    non_attacking = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if board[i] != board[j] and abs(board[i] - board[j]) != abs(i - j):
                non_attacking += 1
                
    return non_attacking  # Higher is better (max = n * (n-1) / 2)

üõ† Step 2: Population Initialization

We generate a random board where each column has one queen.

import random

def create_random_individual(n):
    """Creates a random N-Queens board"""
    return [random.randint(1, n) for _ in range(n)]

def initialize_population(pop_size, n):
    """Creates initial population"""
    return [create_random_individual(n) for _ in range(pop_size)]

üõ† Step 3: Selection Methods

We select parents for the next generation.
1. Tournament Selection

Select k random individuals and pick the best one.

def tournament_selection(population, fitness_scores, k=3):
    """Selects the best individual from k randomly chosen candidates"""
    selected = random.sample(list(zip(population, fitness_scores)), k)
    return max(selected, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]

üõ† Step 4: Crossover Methods

We generate children by combining two parents.
1. Single-Point Crossover

def single_point_crossover(parent1, parent2):
    """Performs single-point crossover"""
    point = random.randint(1, len(parent1) - 1)
    child1 = parent1[:point] + parent2[point:]
    child2 = parent2[:point] + parent1[point:]
    return child1, child2

üõ† Step 5: Mutation

We randomly change a queen's position.

def mutate(individual, mutation_rate=0.2):
    """Mutates a random column by changing its row"""
    if random.random() < mutation_rate:
        index = random.randint(0, len(individual) - 1)
        individual[index] = random.randint(1, len(individual))
    return individual

üõ† Step 6: Genetic Algorithm Execution

def genetic_algorithm(n=8, pop_size=100, generations=500):
    population = initialize_population(pop_size, n)

    for gen in range(generations):
        fitness_scores = [fitness_function(ind) for ind in population]

        if max(fitness_scores) == n * (n - 1) // 2:  # Perfect solution found
            best_index = fitness_scores.index(max(fitness_scores))
            return population[best_index]

        # Selection
        parents = [tournament_selection(population, fitness_scores) for _ in range(pop_size)]

        # Crossover
        next_generation = []
        for i in range(0, pop_size, 2):
            child1, child2 = single_point_crossover(parents[i], parents[i+1])
            next_generation.extend([mutate(child1), mutate(child2)])

        population = next_generation

    # Return best found
    fitness_scores = [fitness_function(ind) for ind in population]
    best_index = fitness_scores.index(max(fitness_scores))
    return population[best_index]

# Run GA for N-Queens (N=8)
best_solution = genetic_algorithm(n=8)
print("Best Solution:", best_solution)

üõ† Summary

explain this part : do this code in cpp and c
ChatGPT said:

This part of the code is implementing neighbor generation for a grid-based search algorithm (like BFS, DFS, or A*). It checks all possible moves (up, down, left, right) and ensures they are within bounds and not blocked.
üîç Explanation (Line by Line)

# Possible moves: up, down, left, right
for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:

    dx, dy represents the change in x and y coordinates for movement.
        (-1,0) ‚Üí Move UP
        (1,0) ‚Üí Move DOWN
        (0,-1) ‚Üí Move LEFT
        (0,1) ‚Üí Move RIGHT

    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

    Compute the new coordinates (nx, ny) after making a move.

    if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] != "#" and (nx, ny) not in visited:

    Check boundaries (nx and ny must be inside the grid).
    Avoid obstacles (grid[nx][ny] != "#") means we cannot go through walls.
    Avoid revisiting nodes (If (nx, ny) is not in visited).

        queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))
        visited.add((nx, ny))

    Add (nx, ny) to the queue to explore later.
    Update visited to avoid duplicate checks.

üõ† Key Differences Between C++ & C Code
Feature	C++ Version	C Version
Data Structures	vector, set, queue	struct, arrays`
Queue Handling	std::queue	Manual queue implementation
Grid Representation	vector<vector<char>>	char grid[ROWS][COLS]
Dynamic Path Tracking	vector<pair<int, int>>	Not included
‚úÖ Summary

    Converted Python logic (Neighbor generation for BFS) into C++ and C.
    Implemented queue-based traversal.
    C++ uses STL (vector, queue), C uses manual arrays.
    C++ tracks the full path, C does not.
